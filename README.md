# Ardiuno_controlling_navigation_2_ultrasonic
this module serves as a template for the users who would like to automate their vehicles or robots using ultrasonic distance sensors (on a small scale)
the module implements two dc motors and two ultrasonic sensors to detect for objects in front and in the back

the code on the arduino covers the following features:
  -> if theres an object in front wait 5 seconds
  -> if the object doesnt move in 5 seconds 
    -> start turning
  -> if the object starts moving 
    -> start moving in front 


futher modules with 3 and 4 ultrasonic sensors will be added soon
